## One Prompt to Segment All Medical Images

OnePrompt Model produces high quality organ/tissue masks on unseen tasks through one unser-given prompted template. It has strong zero-shot performance on a variety of medical image segmentation tasks, including CT, MRI, ultrasound, fundus, and dermoscopic images.

### Implementation

<!-- The code will be released 🔓... not very soon.
Because this project is involved in some commercial use, we are still discussing which parts can be released. 🤔
I am trying my best to release more details to the community, and if everything goes well, I will have an update before September. 📆
I know you're all excited to get your hands on the code, and I am too! 😄 Just bear with us a little longer. We're working hard to make sure that the code is released in a way that is both beneficial to the community and protects our commercial interests.
Thanks for your patience! 🙏-->

Great things comming soon!
